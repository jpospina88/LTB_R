Notes from Shannon's Spontaneous Self-Affirmation protocol for coding ORs

Dimension scales
  Bimodal 0-4 (2 = Neutral)
  Unimodal 0: None;  1: A little;  2: Some;  3: A lot
  Binary 0 = "No", 1 = "Yes"
  Frequency count of some dimensions (how to choose which ones?)

ICC
  For variables with more than two levels, the ICC was calculated using the consistency statistic. 
  For binary variables, ICC was calculated using the exactstatistic.


Questions
Code Session 2 to start - ask Greg on 3/24 if we should also code Session 1 

## Session 1
  
  Control
    Why are study skills important?
    What kinds of study skills can students develop?
    We think it will be most helpful for future students if they hear directly from you, in your own voice, instead of just seeing words on paper.
    What is a study skill you would like to get better at in school, for instance one you might not use well now?
    
  Intervention
    3: Studentsâ€™ experience in school got better in two ways: 
      a) One way was that students said it helped to think about what was important to them personally....What's important to you? Below are some ideas from other students. Please circle 1 to 3 things.
        Pick one you circled above. Tell us why this is important to you.
